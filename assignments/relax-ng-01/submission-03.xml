    <stanza>
        <lead type="imagination">I tried to imagine the phrases only you would say</lead>
        <negation type="bad">but could only hear them falling from someone else’s lips</negation>
    </stanza>


    <stanza><lead type="imagination">I tried to imagine the stories you would tell me</lead>
        <negation type="bad">but your laugh shattered under the weight of this
        grief</negation></stanza>


    <stanza>
        <lead type="memory">I remember the words you would say</lead>
        <negation type="bad">but I don’t remember the voice that said them</negation>
    </stanza>


    <stanza>
        <lead type="memory">I remember you would call me sugar</lead>
        <negation type="bad">but I can’t remember exactly how the <accented>r</accented> melted when
            it met the air</negation>
    </stanza>


    <stanza>
        <lead type="memory">I remember how you’d tell me <accented>baby the lord is always
                watchin</accented></lead>
        <negation type="bad">but I am forgetting how your accent cocooned the warning around my
            ears</negation>
    </stanza>


    <stanza>
        <lead>It’s strange how I cannot remember your voice </lead>
        <negation type="good">but if I heard it I would immediately know it was you</negation>
    </stanza>
