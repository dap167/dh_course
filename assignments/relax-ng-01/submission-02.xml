                Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
                And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
                The unseen good old man.

                O heavy deed!
                It had been so with us, had we been there:
                His liberty is full of threats to all;
                To you yourself, to us, to every one.
                Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
                It will be laid to us, whose providence
                Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
                This mad young man: but so much was our love,
                We would not understand what was most fit;
                But, like the owner of a foul disease,
                To keep it from divulging, let it feed
                Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?

                To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
                O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
                Among a mineral of metals base,
                Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

                The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
                But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed

                Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
                <character>Hamlet</character> in madness hath <character>Polonius</character> slain,
                And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
                Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
                Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

                Come, <character>Gertrude</character>, we'll call up our wisest friends;
                And let them know, both what we mean to do,
                And what's untimely done. O, come away!
                My soul is full of discord and dismay.
