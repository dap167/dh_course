    <introduction>My own <subject>Darling Boy</subject>,</introduction>
    <line>I got your telegram half an hour ago, and just send a line to say that I feel that my only hope of again doing beautiful work in art is being with you. </line>
    <line>It was not so in the old days, but now it is different, and you can really recreate in me that energy and sense of joyous power on which art depends.</line>
    <line>Everyone is furious with me for going back to you, but they don't understand us.</line>
    <line>I feel that it is only with you that I can do anything at all.</line>
    <line>Do remake my ruined life for me, and then our friendship and love will have a different meaning to the world.</line>
    <line type="desire">I wish that when we met at <location>Rouen</location> we had not parted at all.</line>
    <line>There are such wide abysses now of space and land between us. </line>
    <line type="declaration">But we love each other.</line>
    <line type="sign_off">Goodnight, dear. Ever yours,</line>
